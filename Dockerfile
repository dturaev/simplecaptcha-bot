# Install uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/#installing-uv
# Download latest installer
# ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
# Best practice is to pin to a specific uv version:
ADD https://astral.sh/uv/0.4.25/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
# Run installer then remove it
RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh
# Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
ENV PATH="/root/.cargo/bin/:$PATH"

# Copy project requirement files here to ensure they will be cached
# (Do we need to copy the whole project into the image?)

# COPY poetry.lock pyproject.toml ./

# Install runtime dependencies
# Poetry uses $POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_IN_PROJECT internally
# RUN poetry install --no-dev
# COPY uv.lock pyproject.toml ./
# We can mount the required files directly, according to
# https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/

# COPY . /usr/src/simplecaptcha-bot
# If your project contains files that arenâ€™t needed in final image
# (e.g., test files, docs), use `.dockerignore` file to keep image smaller.
ADD . /app
WORKDIR /app
# ADD is similar to COPY, but with more functionality:
# can automatically extract compressed files and download files from URLs.

# CMD defines the default command that runs when container starts from the image;
# does not create a new image layer; executed only when the container starts.
# CMD python -m app

# Typically, we want to tag the production image after building:
# `docker tag <image_id> myapp:latest`
# This is the image we would deploy or share.
# To manage disk space, we can run `docker image prune` to remove unused
# (i.e. untagged) images, including intermediate build images.
